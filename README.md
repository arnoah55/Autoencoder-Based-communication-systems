# Autoencoder-Based-communication-systems


### 📡 E2E AE for Communication  
Jointly learns modulation and coding, achieving near-optimal Symbol Error Rate (SER) on AWGN channels.

### 🔁 Variational Autoencoder (VAE) Advantages  
- Probabilistic latent space  
- Enables uncertainty quantification  
- Supports adaptive rate control

### 🌐 Real-World Applications  
- Ultra-low-latency IoT communication  
- Dynamic spectrum sharing in 5G/6G  
- On-device neural compression

### 🚀 What's Next  
- **ISAC Autoencoder**: Unified waveform design for joint sensing and communication  
- **Online VAE Learning**: Real-time channel adaptation and multi-user extensions
